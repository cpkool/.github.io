Welcome to my github for my quarto website. 
This repository contains the files for my academic website using Quarto. I am fully indebted to others for any code in here that actually works.

Please visit their websites for actual useful help:

I started by using Marvin Schmitt's template, available at https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/ and then quickly started borrowing from my NIU colleagues Ches Thurber (www.chesthurber.com) and Chris Goodman(www.chrisgoodman.com). Thanks Gents.
